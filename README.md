# Cat-Chaos
CS 426 Final Project

Team Members: Arlette Diaz, Nick Filipov, Diego Bravo

# Assignment 6
**Design and Rationale:** In our game "Cat Chaos", the cat (player) must avoid being caught while causing chaos in the house.
We used Mecanim and AI techniques, such as pathfinding and FSMs, to make the cat's owner patrol the house and chase the cat.
We also used waypoints to make a dog that patrols an area of the house. This will make the level difficult for the player to
cause chaos, which encourages them to be strategic.

### AI implementations:
- FSM on the Owner NPC - Nick Filipov
- Pathfinding on the Owner NPC - Diego Bravo
- Waypoints on the Dog NPC - Arlette Diaz

### Mecanim implementations:
- Owner NPC idle+walk - Nick Filipov
- Cat Player idle+walk - Diego Bravo
- Dog NPC idle+walk - Arlette Diaz
